/**
 * A simple utility class that lets you very simply print an arbitrary
 * component. Just pass the component to the PrintUtilities.printComponent. The
 * component you want to print doesn't need a print method and doesn't have to
 * implement any interface or do anything special at all.
 * <P>
 * If you are going to be printing many times, it is marginally more efficient
 * to first do the following:
 * 
 * <PRE>
 * PrintUtilities printHelper = new PrintUtilities(theComponent);
 * </PRE>
 * 
 * then later do printHelper.print(). But this is a very tiny difference, so in
 * most cases just do the simpler
 * PrintUtilities.printComponent(componentToBePrinted).
